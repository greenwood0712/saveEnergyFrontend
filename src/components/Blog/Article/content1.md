# Law firms that don't adopt new technologies are getting left behind.

In some respects, the legal field has been ahead of the tech curve. E-discovery—the process of retrieving, reviewing, cataloging, and producing electronic documents to opposing parties—led to the wide adoption of related software more than a decade ago, a necessary step for managing the increased volume of documents and things subject to discovery. The federal courts launched [PACER](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/03/20/pacer-court-records-225821/) (Public Access to Court Records) to provide online access to federal filings way back in 2001. The next year, the federal judiciary began to roll out its [CM/ECF](https://www.uscourts.gov/court-records/electronic-filing-cmecf/faqs-case-management-electronic-case-files-cmecf) (Case Management/Electronic Case Filing) system, and all filings in federal litigation are now filed electronically.

So why are so many law firms still awash in paper and limping along on legacy systems?

The answer may lie in the foundation of the way legal practices work. Legal work demands caution and restraint, protection of client confidentiality, and reliance on precedent. So perhaps it's not surprising that law firms have been slow to embrace the latest technologies, even when doing so could clearly benefit both staff and clients.

Even the pandemic hasn't prodded significant changes across the legal profession. An [American Bar Association survey](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/law_practice/publications/techreport/2021/cloudcomputing/) on cloud computing found that just 60 percent of firms used web-based services, barely up from 59 percent in 2020. Worse, only 35 percent reported using SSL to keep their data secure, and adoption of other security measures was even lower.

In her work helping law firms improve their practice management, RJH Consulting CEO Krystal Champlin has encountered this resistance firsthand. Part of her role is coaching staff and attorneys through digital transformation, showing them how technology can reduce their stress.

"Digital transformation gives people the opportunity to run their law firm like a true business, and it allows them to be more efficient with their time," Champlin says. "Law firms need to get a plan and start implementing it, or they're going to be behind the curve in a couple of years."

Given the imperative to stay competitive, digital transformation is finally making inroads in the legal world.
