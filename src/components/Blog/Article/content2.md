# The pandemic as transformation catalyst

When COVID-19 sent millions of office workers home, firms that had already begun their digital transformation fared better than those that hadn't. But the pandemic also helped speed the transition for some that were hesitant to pick up new tools.

"If digital transformation was not part of our life, we would die before we reach the finish line," says Reggie Jacinto-Barrientos, founding partner of Philippine law firm PJS Law. "We launched our digital transformation about five years ago," she saysâ€”but then corrects herself, noting that she started her digital transformation five years ago but that the rest of the firm hesitated until the pandemic made the tools she put in place vital to completing their work remotely.

"The pain points were the growing inflow of work, clerical errors, personal time sacrificed, burning out," Jacinto-Barrientos says. "This required us to pause and confront the challenge: How can we be better at what we do best? We saw what others were doing, and this led us to digital transformation."

PJS was able to increase productivity, improve work-life balance, and continue its work uninterrupted through the pandemic thanks to tools that may seem basic now but were new and confusing two years ago, such as video meetings via Zoom. Software that allows her team to collaborate in the cloud has also increased efficiency and cut costs.

Jacinto-Barrientos is so committed to digital transformation that she partnered with Talino Venture Labs, a global venture builder specializing in inclusive innovation, to create UNAWA, a company dedicated to promoting digital transformation in Philippine companies and government agencies. UNAWA's SignSecure is integral to PJS's digital transformation, providing a platform to get electronic signatures on legal documents.

Of course, the best technology is useless if lawyers and staff won't pick it up. Jacinto-Barrientos sees the winning formula as "digital transformation coupled with change management."

"I chose associates who could be my first adopters, and I also used them to get feedback," she says. Those ambassadors assured team members that their input would impact the firm's choices during its digital transformation.

As an example, Jacinto-Barrientos describes two departments in her firm that were fearful of new technologies. In one group, the leader worked hard to open her team members' mind about digital transformation, and they were able to leverage tools to automate reporting. The other group resisted and had to work much harder to gather data to manage its practice. She eventually convinced the second group to adopt the new technologies.

"They're happy!" she says. "They have a skip in their step and excitement in their voice when I talk with them. The important thing is they both got there, and now they're converts."

In her experience, people struggle with the initial steps toward digital transformation before they reap the benefits of an easier workflow. "That's when they say the belated thank you," Jacinto-Barrientos says.
