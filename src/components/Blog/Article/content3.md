# The rise of the digital-native law firm

A whole new law firm model has grown out of legal digital transformation: the digital-native firm.

FTI Law was founded in 2020 to represent whistleblowers as a hybrid, tech-based law firm. While it has an office in Manhattan, the firm's clients are mostly outside the U.S.

With clients scattered across the globe, the challenge was, "How do we build a law firm that has the quality of a New York law firm but is entirely digital?" says John Joy, founding partner and managing attorney at FTI. "We want to make sure that they can get the full offering from us wherever they are in the world."

The firm, which works mainly with international clients to report fraud to the U.S. government, needed a cost-effective and secure way to communicate while protecting clients' identities. "When you're dealing with whistleblowers, there's no group of people who care more about their anonymity and privacy than people who are reporting corporate crime," Joy says.

Quality and client experience were central principles in creating the digital-first firm. "If you want a high-quality digital law firm, it's not just about having the right software," Joy says. "The main thing that drove our digital strategy was market research to find out who our client was." Ease of use and high-end security were found to be two key features that potential customers demand. "The bottom line was security," he says. "That everything is secure, that everything is encrypted." The firm takes a zero trust approach to security, requiring two-factor security and authenticator apps for every interaction, even down to editing its website.

Another aspect of attracting and serving remote clients that's important to FTI is presentation. The firm has invested in infrastructure that helps it hold better video meetings, including good microphones, excellent lighting, and good internet connections. When client meetings are all virtual, professional video and audio are essential. Unlike other New York firms, which might have a whole floor of office space dedicated to meeting clients in spaces with impressive views, surrounded by marble and glass, FTI has to show its bona fides through a video screen. And, Joy points out, clients are judging their video interaction against other media. If the firm wants to impress and build trust, its lawyers have to recognize they're being compared to HBO.

The technology that powers the remote work of the firm also saves money. Lawyers can get digital signatures on documents that previously would have been sent back and forth by international courier. "Without that very low-cost basis, I don't think it would have been possible for us to set up the firm," Joy says. "This practice couldn't have existed, with remote workers in different locations, 10 years ago."

But cost savings weren't the primary driver for FTI's digital model. "It was really driven by the fact that most of our clients are from outside the U.S. and can't come to meet us in person," Joy says. "In that respect, we didn't really have a choice but to focus on digital, and then the challenge was giving the standard of quality digitally that someone would experience walking into a New York law firm."
