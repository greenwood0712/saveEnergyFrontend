HPE does not sell, rent or lease personal data to others except as described in this Privacy Statement. We may share and/or disclose your personal data as follows:

Disclosure within the HPE group of companies. HPE has its headquarters in the United States of America and operates worldwide. HPE may disclose your personal data as necessary within the HPE group of companies in connection with how we use your personal data.

Disclosure to third parties. HPE retains suppliers and service providers to manage or support its business operations, provide professional services, deliver products, services and customer solutions and to assist HPE with marketing and sales communication initiatives. Those third parties may receive and process your personal data under appropriate instructions, as necessary to support and facilitate how we use your personal data. Suppliers and service providers are required by contract to keep confidential and secure the information they process on behalf of HPE and may not use it for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing for HPE.

Where HPE engages with partners, resellers and/or distributors as part of its business operations, HPE may disclose your personal data to them in order to facilitate sales and delivery of its products and services. Partners, resellers and/or distributors are required by contract to keep confidential and secure the information received from HPE and may use it only for the said purposes, unless otherwise authorised by you or applicable laws and regulations.

Except as described in this Privacy Statement, HPE will not share your personal data with third parties without your permission, unless to: (i) respond to duly authorized information requests of police and governmental authorities; (ii) comply with law, regulation, subpoena, or court order; (iii) enforce/protect the rights and properties of HPE or its subsidiaries; or (iv) protect the rights or personal safety of HPE, our employees, and third parties on or using HPE property when allowed and in each case in accordance with applicable law.

Circumstances may arise where, whether for strategic or other business reasons, HPE decides to sell, buy, merge or otherwise reorganize businesses in some countries. Such a transaction may involve the disclosure of personal data to prospective or actual purchasers, or the receipt of it from sellers. It is HPEâ€™s practice to seek appropriate contractual protection for personal data in these types of transactions.
