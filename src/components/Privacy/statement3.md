------------------------------------------

HPE may transfer your personal data as necessary within the HPE group of companies and to other third parties. The recipients may be located in countries which do not provide the same level of data protection as the country in which you are located. HPE will take steps to ensure personal data we transfer is adequately protected as required by applicable data protection laws. Where required by local law, we will request your consent to transfer your personal data.

Transfers within HPE group of companies. HPE has an intra-company agreement on the transfer and processing of personal data within the HPE group of companies. This agreement also forms the basis of HPE’s Binding Corporate Rules for Controller which have been approved by the Data Protection Regulators in Europe and some other countries. The BCRs allow HPE to ensure that personal data transferred internationally within the HPE group is adequately protected in accordance with applicable data protection laws. If you would like to learn more about our BCRs and the countries that have approved them, please click [here](https://www.hpe.com/us/en/privacy/bcr-pages.html).

HPE’s privacy practices described in this Privacy Statement comply with the APEC Cross Border Privacy Rules (CBPR) System, including transparency, accountability, and choice regarding the collection and use of personal data. The CBPR system provides a framework for organizations to ensure protection of personal data transferred among participating APEC economies. More information about the CBPR framework can be found [here](http://cbprs.org/). The CBPR certification does not cover information that may be collected through downloadable software on third party platforms. If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern related to HPE’s APEC Certification that we have not addressed satisfactory, please contact our U.S. based third party dispute resolution [here](https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request).

Transfers to third parties. With respect to transfers to third parties located in countries which do not provide an adequate level of data protection, HPE will take appropriate safeguards such as signing EU Standard Contractual Clauses, or other model clauses approved by a data protection authority, with the recipient, relying on approved codes of conduct or certification mechanisms adopted by the recipient or binding and enforceable commitments of the recipient. If you would like to receive more information about the appropriate safeguards and/or receive a copy of the relevant mechanism for your review, please contact the [HPE Privacy Office](https://privacyportal.onetrust.com/webform/8c68e411-6bf3-4c9e-8800-9c72d0dc273a/8f599c3a-a3a5-4db9-ae19-2fc954a70130).
